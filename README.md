This is a GUI application created using Tkinter. This project focuses on developing a tool that evaluates the strength of a password. A
password's strength can be quantified using factors like entropy (randomness), length,
and complexity (combination of letters, numbers, and special characters). This tool helps users create stronger passwords, thus reducing the risk of unauthorized
access and improving overall security.
